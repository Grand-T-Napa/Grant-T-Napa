What is an NFT?	<p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token that represents a unique asset. NFTs are tokenized versions of digital or real-world assets. They function as a record of verifiable proofs of authenticity and ownership within a blockchain network. Each token contains a small amount of arbitrary data which points to the actual asset it represents. NFTs are not interchangeable with each other (making it "non- fungible") and introduce scarcity to the digital world.<br><br>The data inside NFT badges provided by projects on Aviyel, will contain the link to the contributions that you have made. So with the badge NFT, you can prove your contributions to the world, using a token. How cool is that!</p> 1
Why do you need an NFT?	<div class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">Badges lives on centralised servers which could go down during security outages, but Badge NFT will live on the blockchain without downtime due to the decentralized nature of blockchains.</div></div>	2
Why should I mint my badges as an NFT?	<div class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">The value of an NFT is highly dependent on the data it contains and represents. The contributions you have made to the project will be put on a public blockchain, an immutable database, and will be available for verification by maintainers, community, organisations or even potential recruiters. Your NFT badges could be used to represent your portfolio. Proof of your contributions will outlive platforms and projects.</div></div>	3
What is the blockchain?	<div class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">A Blockchain refers to an open restrictionless publicly available distributed ledger. Blockchains maintain a "single source of truth" by distributing the same copy of the ledger, which contains a record of transactions, among a group of participants by sharing and synchronizing information concurrently among all network participants. Therefore every record in the ledger is seen by everybody and every change made to the ledger is reflected across all participants in the network. So the information stored on the ledger becomes "immutable" as long as majority of the network participants aren't compromised.</div></div	4
What is a blockchain wallet?	<div class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">A blockchain wallet or a cryptocurrency wallet allows users to manage different kinds of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets such as NFTs. A blockchain wallet provides an interface to move digital assets easily. The privacy and identity of the user is maintained, by providing 'public addresses' without asking for any personal information. These addresses are where the digital assets are stored. These wallets are accessible from web and mobile.</div></div>	5
What is a block-explorer?	<p>A block explorer is a blockchain 'search engine' that allows you to search for a particular piece of information on the blockchain. This information could be transaction activities on a blockchain address and the status of a transaction, among other useful information.<br><br>We recommend using polygonscan, a blockchain explorer built for Polygon chain, for checking the status of your NFT "minting" transactions.</p>	6
Where can you find your NFT?	<div class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">You can click on the tokenID of the badge and be redirected to the block explorer to verify the badge NFT. You can also download mobile wallets like Metamask or TrustWallet and import your blockchain address there and "see" the NFT under NFT sections.</div></div>	7
How can I view my NFT on my metamask wallet?	<p>MetaMask Mobile displays NFTs under Collectibles. Please remember that some NFTs will not show up on the mobile app under Collectibles or may not show up correctly.</p><ol class="ml-4"><li>Tap on the 'NFTs' tab, scroll down, and tap on the "+ ADD NFTs" link.</li><li>Copy the contract address from Aviyel platform and paste the NFT's address from your clipboard into the "Address" box.</li><li>Copy the TokenID and Paste the ID into the box marked "ID" in MetaMask Mobile, tap on the "ADD" button, and your NFTs should appear under the NFTs tab..</li></ol>	8
What is a non-transferable NFT?	<div><div class="min-h-screen bg-white"><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row"><div class="flex flex-row items-start flex-1 bg-grey-9 z-10"><div class="flex flex-col max-w-5xl px-3 mx-auto mt-6 md:px-0 mb-25"><section class="mt-8"><div id="what_is_non-transferable_NFT" class="bg-white mb-3 border rounded border-grey-6"><div class="p-3 px-4 pl-16 leading-6 text-14 md:text-16 text-grey-2">The badge NFT's that you receive is a proof of your contribution to the project. The purpose of this NFT is defeated if it is tradable or transferred. So we have removed the ability to transfer this NFT to any other blockchain addresses. Hence non-transferable NFTs.</div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>	9
